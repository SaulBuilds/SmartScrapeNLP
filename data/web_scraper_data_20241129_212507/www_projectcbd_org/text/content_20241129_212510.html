<p>A garden of educational delights</p><graphic src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/project-CBD-horiz-rule-color-1024x73.png" alt=""/><p>Project CBD is the original and longest-running online resource for information about both CBD and medical cannabis. Established in 2010, we were instrumental in introducing cannabidiol to the medical marijuana community in California. A platform for scientists, health professionals, career journalists, and drug reform activists, Project CBD serves as a centralized hub of research and writing about cannabinoid science, plant medicine, psychedelics, sustainable economies, and drug policy. We provide ways for consumers to identify and find high quality, artisanal, CBD-rich products — and ways for ethical product manufacturers to be discovered by consumers.</p><h2>CBD, Cannabis &amp; Health Conditions</h2><p>In our 13 years of operation, Project CBD has consolidated a large volume of peer-reviewed studies, analyses, and research on the medical uses of cannabinoids.</p><p>We have archived this information by condition and summarized the findings where possible to make the information more accessible to non-scientists. Browse by condition to learn more about the therapeutic potential of cannabinoids. Our website should not be considered as a source of medical advice, but as a place to discover and compare vetted studies and research.</p><p><a href="/health/medical-uses-of-cbd/">Medical Uses of Cannabinoids: An Introduction →</a> </p><h4>Cancer</h4><p>Over 250 peer-reviewed science reports on CBD and cannabis for cancer, patient surveys, and more.</p><h4>Neurological diseases</h4><p>Over 350 science reviews and research papers on Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, MS, ALS &amp; Huntington’s disease.</p><h3>More health conditions</h3><h2>Cannabidiol Explained:</h2><graphic src="/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/project-CBD-horiz-rule-color-1024x73.png" alt=""/><h3>CBD vs. THC</h3><p>Cannabidiol is closely related to another important medicinally active phytocannabinoid: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the compound that causes the “high” that cannabis is famous for. These are the two components of cannabis that have been most studied by scientists.</p><p>Both CBD and THC have significant therapeutic attributes. But unlike THC, cannabidiol does not make a person feel “stoned” or intoxicated. That’s because CBD and THC act in different ways on different receptors in the brain and body.</p><p>CBD can actually lessen or neutralize the psychoactive effects of THC, depending on how much of each compound is consumed. Many people want the health benefits of cannabis without the high – or with less of a high. The fact that cannabidiol is therapeutically potent as well as non-intoxicating, and easy to take in various forms, makes it an appealing treatment option for those who are cautious about trying cannabis for the first time. Many people are seeking alternatives to pharmaceuticals with harsh side effects – medicine more in sync with natural processes.</p><p>By tapping into how we function biologically on a deep level, cannabidiol can provide relief for chronic pain, anxiety, inflammation, depression and many other conditions.</p><h3>Best Ways to Take CBD</h3><p>Unsure about how to use cannabidiol-infused products?
